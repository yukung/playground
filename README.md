# http-server-sample

This is a repository for learning the mechanism of the HTTP server.

- multi-thread: multi threading for Request/Response.
- io-multiplexing: non blocking I/O for Request/Response.
- another-simple-server: another implementation.

### Disclaimer

Because it does not implement the full functionality as a HTTP server, also it can not take responsibility suffered by using the source code.
